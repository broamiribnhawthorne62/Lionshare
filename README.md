Raising hell bout nothing much but wanting it all
I once remembered how being around men like Bro. Yahree and Sundiata Acoli up USP Lvnwth and once while going through checkpoint from the Unicore facility, a racist had it in mind to brush past us both ahead through the metal detector as a CO stood watching(something you dont do), and i wanted to confront him for doing so near the building's entry but Yahree stopped me saying, you cant kill everybody for the wrongs they commit against you because otherwise, you'll never be able to put your gun away in time(meaning: the barrel of a gun staying hot if you keep shooting everything moving). This invaluable piece of information stuck with me for a long time, even to this day. You see, some ppl wants it all(when they want it) and care nothing about whose watching or really getting away with what they go after in life. But there are those of us who do and have one or more reasons for doing so. Now, that's what smart is being all about - Thinking it through(sometimes fast-like).
